# Separation of Concerns — Automated Enforcement

The separation of concerns skill defines structural and dependency rules for organizing TypeScript projects into `features/`, `platform/`, and `shell/`. These rules can be automatically enforced using [dependency-cruiser](https://github.com/sverweij/dependency-cruiser).

## What It Enforces

dependency-cruiser statically analyzes your TypeScript imports and validates them against architectural rules. The example configuration below covers these checklist items from the skill:

| Rule | What it catches |
|------|----------------|
| `root-structure` | Files outside `features/`, `platform/`, `shell/` |
| `platform-structure` | Anything in `platform/` that isn't `domain/` or `infra/` |
| `feature-structure` | Feature subfolders that aren't `entrypoint/`, `commands/`, `queries/`, `domain/` |
| `entrypoint-no-domain` | Entrypoints importing directly from `domain/` |
| `entrypoint-restricted-deps` | Entrypoints importing from anything other than `commands/`, `queries/`, `platform/infra/` |
| `no-cross-feature-imports` | One feature importing from another feature |
| `commands-no-cross-feature` | Commands importing from other features |
| `commands-must-use-domain` | Commands that don't import from their feature's `domain/` (required rule) |
| `queries-no-commands` | Queries importing from `commands/` |
| `domain-no-upward-deps` | Domain importing from commands/, queries/, entrypoint/, or shell/ |
| `shell-no-domain` | Shell importing from domain/ (shell is thin wiring only) |
| `platform-no-features` | platform/domain/ or platform/infra/ importing from features/ |
| `commands-no-queries` | Commands importing from queries/ (write path cannot depend on read path) |
| `commands-no-infra-cli` | Commands importing from infra/cli/ (CLI utilities are for entrypoints only) |
| `queries-no-infra-cli` | Queries importing from infra/cli/ (CLI utilities are for entrypoints only) |
| `no-nested-commands` | Nested folders inside commands/ (should be flat command files only) |
| `no-nested-queries` | Nested folders inside queries/ (should be flat query files only) |
| `no-root-infra-files` | Files at infra/ root (all files must be in sub-folders) |
| `no-root-platform-infra-files` | Files at platform/infra/ root (all files must be in sub-folders) |
| `no-circular` | Circular dependencies anywhere |

Rules that require human judgment (e.g. "commands contain no business rules", "queries never mutate state", "entrypoint is thin") are not automatable and remain in the skill checklist.

## Setup

```bash
npm install --save-dev dependency-cruiser
```

Copy the example configuration below into `.dependency-cruiser.mjs` at your project root.

## Example Configuration

```

## Usage

```bash
npx depcruise --config .dependency-cruiser.mjs src/
```

Clean output on a compliant project:

```
✔ no dependency violations found (46 modules, 111 dependencies cruised)
```

Violation output:

```
error no-cross-feature-imports: src/features/checkout/commands/place-order.ts
  → src/features/refunds/domain/refund.ts

error commands-must-use-domain: src/features/checkout/commands/cancel-order.ts

x 2 dependency violations (2 errors, 0 warnings). 46 modules, 111 dependencies cruised.
```

The process exits non-zero on violations, so it fails CI automatically.

## HTML Report

```bash
npx depcruise --config .dependency-cruiser.mjs --output-type err-html -f violations.html src/
```

Generates a standalone HTML page listing all violations grouped by rule, with violation counts and rule explanations.

## Adapting the Configuration

The `from.path` patterns use regex, not globs. Adjust them to match your source layout:

- **Monorepo with multiple packages:** Change `src/` to match your package paths (e.g. `packages/[^/]+/src/`)
- **Different source root:** Replace `src/` in the `root-structure` rule with your root
- **tsconfig location:** Update `options.tsConfig.fileName` to point to your tsconfig
